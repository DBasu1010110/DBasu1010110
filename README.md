# Data Science Portfolio and Other Interests

Welcome! This repository showcases a curated set of advanced data science and statistics projects, including data on video games.
The goal is to construct a repo in applied statistical modeling, machine learning, causal inference, and real-world data analysis.
One of my primary interests is gaming, especially balace and design of characters and classes. So, a lot of the analyses will include data related to videogames.
